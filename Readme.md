# The application is currently in development!

## Introduction

The EndpointTester is a simple web-based tool designed to send HTTP requests to specified endpoints using various HTTP methods. The project provides an intuitive interface for users to select a request method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) and input a target URL. Upon submission, the request is sent to a backend server, which processes the request and returns a response.
